# MANIFESTO

There is no doubt that the world is evolving at a faster rate than ever. Life can be incredibly frustating and hard for the majortiy of people around the world, and it is difficult to gauge what lies ahead. Our philosophy comes from our love for the internet, the colossal amount of information it stores, and the possibilies it creates for collaborative learning.

1rem is built on 5 core beliefs. They are:

- The internet is the greatest library.
- My skill can be your skill.
- Peer motivation is powerful.
- We learn alone, together.
- You don't fit in that box.

We are building an open sourced collaborative learning experience like no other. We embrace everyone and their quirks. Our quirks are what makes us unique. Everybody has a story, a skill set, and experiences, which are seeds of inspiration for someone else. Our platform focuses on magnifying these qualities to provide a safe place for learners to learn from each other.
